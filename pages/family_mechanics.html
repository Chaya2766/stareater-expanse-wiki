<h1>Family mechanics</h1>
<hr>

<article>
Legal issues arise particularly from copying of mind uploads, but also from cloned individuals which do not have anything like recognizable family. Regardless of how a given legal system deals with the problems, what laws they pass, and whether or not it is fair, regulation becomes easier when there is common vocabulary in place to convey the right concepts, as such a few "family types" had become popular in legal speak across the Stareater Expanse to make clarification easier once defining an individual is insufficient.

<h2>Descendancy</h2>
<article>
One or multiple <u>creators</u> create <u>descendants</u> based on themselves, which inherit some of their attributes but do not inherit their experiences. These descendants are often called children but the word carries a lot of extra meaning that may not be applicable in this situation, as such <u>descendant</u> is used instead to specify that some attributes were inherited, but not experiences.
<br><br>
Descendants typically aren't seen as liable for their creator's infractions or achievements, but in some legal systems they may inherit liabilities such as fulfilling financial obligations in case of their creator's death, especially those where laws exist that strongly bind the creators to provide some level of aid to their descendants.
<br><br>
This is the model that would be most familiar to protohumans.

<h2>Divergency</h2>
<article>
One original creates copies of themselves, which undergo normal personal development such as accumulating new memories and experiences, eventually becoming decisively different from the original. All the copies and the original (if still alive) are called <u>divergents</u> after the copying process, meanwhile the one original as they existed before the copying becomes a <u>source</u>, and represents one unified entity that the divergents used to be.
<br><br>
In this case the divergents typically are seen liable for only the acts committed by the original up until the point where they were created - theoretically in the case the divergent was made after the original decided to commit a crime but before it was actually committed, some legal systems could consider them liable for conspiracy to commit a crime, but there is notable difficulty determining such situations with certainty.
<br><br>
In example, consider Bob, who has a criminal record. Bob uploads his mind and becomes a digital entity, then copies himself, with the original renaming himself to Bob1, and the copy taking on the name Bob2. Legally this means that both Bob1 and Bob2 are divergents originating from the source Bob. The source Bob still has a criminal record. Both Bob1 and Bob2 inherit the criminal record from the source Bob, but if Bob1 goes on to then commit more crimes, Bob2 would ordinarily not be responsible for that. If he happens to live under a legal system which has a law saying that, as a divergent of Bob1 he should have known and contacted the authorities, then he is unlucky, and will in fact be responsible for something, law is not always fair after all.

<h2>Convergency</h2>
<article>
two or more individuals are bound with a mechanism that counteracts their natural divergence and tweaks their minds to maintain one identity that shares all the experiences and attributes. The convergents are however still individuals, and the distinction might be meaningful in various edge cases. In most legal systems, in this case all the convergents may be found liable for acts commited by any single one that is part of the convergency. The convergents need not be copies of one individual, the label still applies even when each of the convergents were originally independent people with separate origins, but this creates issues that some polities view important enough to further specify homoconvergency and polyconvergency.
<br><br>
In example, imagine Felicity, a digital entity who decided to copy herself, but implement software that will keep the minds of all copies synchronized, so that they all remember the same things and display the same mental characteristics. In the case that Felicity16 murders someone, every single copy from Felicity1 to Felicity15 may also be responsible.
<br><br>
In addition, let's say Felicity fell in love with Bob, who commited murder, so much so that she became linked with him in a convergency and has his memories, now every single copy from Felicity1 to Felicity16 might also be found liable for that murder. 
<br><br>
In another case, if someone contacted each Felicity with an offer, and one Felicity6 who was not in the right mental state at the moment ended up signing a very extortive contract, indeed all 16 would be boud by it, or perhaps under the local law all 16 would need to agree to it.
<br><br>
How the local law would deal with such situations is local law's issue, but having the vocabulary at least makes formulating the law easier.
