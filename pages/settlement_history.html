<h1>Settlement timeline of the Stareater Expanse</h1>
<img src="../images/Stareater_Expanse.png" class="basics"></img>
<article class="basics">
The <a href="stareater_expanse.html">Stareater Expanse</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster">globular cluster</a> named after the intents of the settlers that arrived in it.
<br><br>
The densely packed cluster creates ideal conditions for interstellar travel, with stars commonly being as little as 0.1ly apart from their closest neighbours.

<article>timeline of initial events relevant to the settling of the Stareater Expanse with dates given in megaseconds and gigaseconds.</article>

  <!--<dt><b>-191Gs : start of the journey</b></dt><dd>Pioneer makes the 6 thousand year journey towards the globular cluster. Largely uneventful.</dd>-->
  <dt><b>-632Ms : Pioneer enters the Stareater Expanse</b></dt>
    <dd>-315Ms : Pioneer executes a gravity assist with the central black hole of the globular cluster, slowing down and adjusting course towards the most fertile system detected</dd>
    <dd>-1.8Ms : Pioneer executes final slowdown burn in the target system and sets course for the asteroid belt</dd>
    <dd>-0.6Ms : self-replicating swarms begin to eat through the asteroid belt to set up power collection and industrial infrastructure</dd>
  <dt><b>time zero : first permanent navigation beacon</b></dt>
    <dd>initial exponential growth phase is established with infrastructure doubling time of approx. 10.5Ms</dd>
    <dd>+211.6Ms : power generation crosses 100 Gigawatts - 0.5 on the kardashev scale<br>
    First habitat construction projects begin</dd>
    <dd>+250Ms : Cloning of an initial human population started</dd>
    <dd>+386.6Ms : power generation crosses 10 Petawatts - 1 on the kardashev scale</dd>
    <dd>+519.6Ms : initial growth phase concludes with 1.344 on the kardashev scale as the easily accessible resources in the asteroid belt are depleted, infrastructure doubling time falls significantly</dd>
    <dd>+900Ms : first batches of cloned humans reach maturity</dd>
  <dt><b>1Gs : expansion age</b></dt>
    <dd>interstellar spacecraft with volunteer colonists are launched to several of the most promising systems in the Stareater Expanse<br>
    seeds of divergence are planted and humanity continues it's long march towards all enlightenments and apocalypses</dd>
    <dd>+1.1Gs : first spacecraft arrive and begin developing their target systems</dd>
    <dd>+1.3Gs : first multicelular xenobiota encounter</dd>
    <dd>+1.6Gs : first batches of naturally born humans reach maturity</dd>
    <dd>+1.8Gs : last of the first wave interstellar spacecraft arrive at their target systems<br>
    second multicelular xenobiota encounter</dd>
  <dt><b>2Gs : emergence age</b></dt>
    <dd>systems settled in the first expansion wave begin to send out their own interstellar missions<br>
    Interstellar transport and communication networks begin to form across the center of the Stareater Expanse</dd>
    <dd>+2.1Gs : Tarici de-extinction success</dd>
    <dd>+2.5Gs : near stars outside of the Stareater Expanse begin to receive first settlers</dd>
  <dt><b>3Gs : coalescence age</b></dt>
    <dd>first systems settled during the emergence age begin to engage in interstellar activity<br>
    revived xenobiota spreads throughout the cluster and integrates into society</dd>
