<article class="basics">
Catalict is a posthuman <a href="hyperintellect.html">hyperintellect</a> widely recognized as the matter-of-fact ruler of the <a href="noca_bell.html">Noca Bell habitat cluster</a>. He is known to value diversity, best illustrated by his apparent mission to peacefully collect as many species and cultures (sometimes including ones mutually hostile to some degree) within Noca Bell as he can get away with.
<!--<br></br>
By his own claims, he is one of the distantly diverged copies of the original hyperintellect which seeded civilization in the <a href="dyson_stareater_expanse.html">Stareater Expanse</a>.-->

<article>Catalict uses an avatar of a heavily stylized fractal boid to mark his presence in virtual spaces, sometimes mistaken for a tree. A front-facing picture of it in a specific pose is also typically the symbol the catalict is identified by.

In general, embodiment is rare to witness from Catalict, as he generally maintains the appearance of an entity that exists primarily within the information realm, and reaches out to rearrange the world as needed, rather than the other way around. He usually only partakes in physical interactions by taking control of the environment (remotely opening doors, turning cameras, operating wall-mounted manipulators and displays or simple drones), but on occasion where he deems it fitting he may collect a mass of various kinds of micrites to behave as one coherent form to present himself with.</article>
