<article>I have a warning to you that the site is made purely of HTML and CSS as much as possible, and I had to use some workarounds that make it awkward to use in some aspects. The only thing that Javascript is used for across the entire site is redirecting you to exact pages if you use a URL copied from the "link to this page" text, so aside from that small feature it should be completely functional even if you have javascript, cookies, and generally everything else disabled</article>

<h1>Home page - Stareater Expanse</h1>

Stareater Expanse is my attempt to canibalize some of my many abandoned writing and art projects and include some of the still active ones into one coherent whole.
<br><br>
I specialize in hard science fiction, and have an affinity for exploring concepts very deeply, rigorously, down to the hard numbers based on real science. Unfortunately, this results in very little writing actually getting done, and an overwhelming amount of scrapped concepts that could have made for interesting fiction.
<br>
Enjoyers of <a href="https://www.orionsarm.com/">Orion's Arm</a> should find themselves right at home here.

<h1>colour-coded elements:</h1>

<article class="soft">green marking denote relaxed constraint on scientific plausibility, this does not mean I've given up on the hard sci-fi themes, you will not see magic or made up laws of physics in my writing here, it just means there are elements that hardcore hard sci-fi fans might find particularly questionable or lacking satisfying explanations. The reason something would end up marked as this would usually be that I found strict verification of what I'm writing was slowing me down too much or was too difficult and allowed myself to delve into more speculative things without too much verification for the sake of delivering on interesting concepts quicker</article>

<!--<article class="external">magenta marking denotes that the piece of content presented is actually a reference to an external piece of content that I for whatever reason chose not to fully present on this site</article>-->

<article class="abandoned">abandoned content is grayed out, and represents that the given piece of content had once existed but had been mostly written out by now, yet was also judged still valuable enough to preserve in a way that keeps it visible</article>

<article class="meta">Meta content, that is information basing on things not present in the setting or just talking about writing intent, are marked with this colour (this lights up for easier reading when hovered over). This is occasionally useful for immersion reasons and might also make it more clear when I'm writing something that should not be taken as establishing in-lore events.</article>
