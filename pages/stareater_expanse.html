<article class="basics">
The Stareater Expanse is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster">globular cluster</a> consisting of approximately 10 thousand stars adding up to roughly 8400 solar masses, as well as a central black hole of about 800 solar masses.
<br><br>
It was named by the first settlers after what they were planning to do with it, that is complete dysonization of every viable star as well as starlifting, likely leading to eventual complete dismantling of the cluster. In the centuries since it had been renamed many times over by the inhabitants, but in most languages and cultures it maintains some reference to consuming stars.
<br><br>
The densely packed cluster creates ideal conditions for interstellar travel, with stars commonly being as little as 0.1ly apart from their closest neighbours.

<article>A simple system of x/y/z coordinates is usually used to denote positions within the cluster, where the X axis points towards the galactic center, the Y axis points in the direction in which the galaxy is spinning, and the Z axis points to the galactic north. The center of mass of the cluster is taken to be the 0/0/0 point in this coordinate system, which corresponds closely but not exactly to the central black hole.
<br><br>
The coordinate grid on the model on the right uses light years as a conceptually convenient unit.
