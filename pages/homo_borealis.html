<article class="basics">
Homo Borealis, a species belonging to the human genus with characteristics useful for living in very cold environments as well as low pressures. They are characterized by their large bodies and thick, resilient skin lacking in sweat glands. Their large volume to surface area ratio and thick dry skin help retain heat.
<br><br>
One unique and noticeable adaptation of the boreal humans is modification of the lower eyelid into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane">nictitating membrane</a> (sometimes confusingly just called a "third eyelid" as it would be in birds, despite the boreals still only having 2 eyelids) that allows them to retain a reduced quality of sight while protecting the eye from harsh conditions, including vacuum.
<br><br>
Due to the very significant genetic differences between protohumans and boreal humans, interbreeding almost universally results in malformed fetuses that fail to grow all the necessary vital organs, of which an early sign in the fetal development is the complete lack of eyes. On the occasion the brain forms, it usually does not function, but there had been cases of extreme medical intervention saving the offspring and enabling it to grow into severely disabled individuals.
