<h1>Homo Borealis</h1>

<article class="basics">
Homo Borealis, more colloquially known as boreal humans or boreals, a species belonging to the human genus with characteristics useful for living in very cold environments as well as low pressures. They are characterized by their large bodies and thick, resilient skin lacking in sweat glands. Their large volume to surface area ratio and thick dry skin help retain heat.
<br><br>
One unique and noticeable adaptation of the boreal humans is modification of the lower eyelid into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane">nictitating membrane</a> (sometimes confusingly just called a "third eyelid" as it would be in birds, despite the boreals still only having 2 eyelids) that allows them to retain a reduced quality of sight while protecting the eye from harsh conditions, including vacuum.
<br><br>
Due to the very significant genetic differences between protohumans and boreal humans, interbreeding almost universally results in malformed fetuses that fail to grow all the necessary vital organs, of which an early sign in the fetal development is the complete lack of eyes. On the occasion the brain forms, it usually does not function, but there had been cases of extreme medical intervention saving the offspring and enabling it to grow into severely disabled individuals.

<h2>celular adaptations</h2>

<article>Homo borealis cells produce <b>tardigrade damage protection proteins</b> that protect the cells from damage due to freezing and dehydration, much like in tardigrades from which the genes to produce these protein were sourced. Their cells also accumulate a high concentration of glucose much like wood frogs, further protecting the cells from potential ice crystal formation and the resulting damage.
<br><br>
The end result is that boreal humans experience frostbite very differently. A fully frozen body part could be thawed out and only suffer painful inflamation for a while before returning to normal, rather than becoming necrotic.
<br><br>
These celular behaviours also require a domino chain of further adaptations to mitigate the negative and potentially fatal effects they would otherwise have if introduced into normal protohuman cells, which is the main barrier separating boreal humans into their own species within the human genus.</article>

<h2>anatomical adaptations</h2>

<article>The skin of boreal humans is thick and does not have any sweat glands, instead cooling is achieved mainly through the nasal cavity being in contact with the cold air of the envrionment. This places boreal humans at risk of heatstroke in warmer environments where this method of cooling is not available.
<br><br>
Boreals have a fully functional third eyelid, genetically engineered on the basis of the vestigial remnants of a nictitating membrane present in protohumans. Closing the third eyelid will provide protection to the eye while significantly limiting but not completely blocking the ability to see, useful in harsh conditions.
<br><br>
Larger body decreases the surface to volume ratio, allowing them to maintain body heat for longer. A typical healthy boreal human would mass 150kg and stand 2.2m tall, having 200% the body mass of an average protohuman while being only 126% as tall and having 159% as much skin.
