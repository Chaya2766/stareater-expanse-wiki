Rotating habitats use centrifugal force to simulate gravity. They are about 11 million times more efficient at providing living space for a given amount of material than planets, and by far the most common type of large settlement in space.

<h3>Fictitious force effects</h3>
<article>Aside from the centrifugal force, other forces can make movement around the habitat difficult. The coriolis force can lead to accidents on staircases, as a person who is moving towards or away from the axis of rotation of the habitat will have to match the new tangential velocity of the environment, as parts of the habitat farther away from the axis of rotation move proportionally faster.
<br><br>
In example of a 200 metre radius habitat rotating once every 28.099 seconds, a staircase with 20cm tall steps has a different velocity at every step (about 4.472cm/s difference) which a person walking down the stairs would feel as a force they have to counteract. You can imagine that, if the staircase is poorly positioned and the force is pointing away from the stairs, this small shove can cause a person to miss a step, trip, and consequently experience even more fictitious force, turning what would have otherwise been a small stumble into a long fall all the way down the stairs. If the stairs were positioned the other way around, that same force might have actually helped and stopped the person from falling.
<br><br>
Similarly in an elevator a person will experience a constant sideways force proportional to how quickly the elevator is moving, which would feel as if the gravity is suddenly angled, so providing handles to brace oneself against it would be a good consideration.
<br><br>
Lastly, this same force could aid the <b>sense of direction</b>, as a person would be easily able to tell their orientation in relation to the direction of the habitat's spin, potentially making spinwards and anti-spinwards very useful terms in the same way that east and west are.</article>

<h3>habitat sizes</h3>
<article>Maximum radius a habitat can be safely built with varies by material and desired level of gravity. Not all habitats are meant to emulate terran gravity, especially as not all human species are used to it, not all people like it even if they are of a species made to exist within such gravity, and the alien species did not evolve for terran levels of gravity anyway.<br><br>
It is standard to build a habitat such that the stress in its walls is only half that of the maximum stress the material can handle, this allows a section of the habitat wall to support up to it's own mass worth of buildings, though almost always some margin is kept just in case, such as having each section of the wall only support half it's own mass worth of buildings.
<br><br>
It is most common to see habitats built with aerial density of 10 tonnes per square metre for radiation shielding reasons, which with a safety factor of 2 in turn allows 10 additional tonnes of buildings and other infrastructure to be placed on each square metre of the wall before it breaks. This can be increased by just making the habitat smaller, thus increasing the material strength safety margin and allowing each section of the wall to support more than it's own mass, or building a thicker wall which does not affect the safety margin but makes the impact of adding mass on top of it smaller.</article>
