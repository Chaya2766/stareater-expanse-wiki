<h1>Fralintae</h1>

<article class="basics">
Fralintae are a pseudo-species of fully artificial beings created by a collaboration of allegedly several hundred to several thousand <a href="hyperintellect.html">hyperintellects</a> in the outer EoE dyson.
<br><br>
They are a completely physiologically novel form of life built primarily on metallic elements, and reliant on alphavoltaic and thermoelectric metabolism to function, primarily feeding on Polonium-210.
<br><br>
Psychologically Fralintae are very similar to protohumans, but are notably almost entirely incapable of suffering, and heavily reliant on conscious reasoning combined with hardwired instincts rather than emotional responses to avoid common threats.
<br><br>
Interestingly enough, the creation of Fralintae was met with riotous condemnation by many hyperintellects that learned about the project, some however were happy to acquire a blueprint and grow their own as sapient pets.

<h3 class="thread" id="thread">Safety considerations of polonium as food</h3>
<div class="thread">
<article> Before getting into nuclear safety one should be reminded that the Eternity of Everything is already full of societies where aliens coexist, and as such are already used to managing the danger that organisms evolved under vastly different chemical conditions pose to each other.
<br>
Polonium-210 has a number of beneficial characteristics:<br>
1. it is exclusively an alpha emitter, which does not require much shielding<br>
2. a relatively short half-life as far as far as nuclear fuels go, which significantly limits the length of time that lost samples and contaminated areas will remain dangerous<br>
3. decay chain which does not include other unstable isotopes, making it even safer than Plutonium-238</article>
This is unfortunately true only for specifically polonium-210 and not the other isotopes of polonium, as illustrated below.

<br>
The expected total Polonium-210 content in a fralinta is only about 5 grams at most, which would take 25.744 half-lives, corresponding to about 9.75 terran years or 307.8 megaseconds, to decay down to the median lethal dose to an unaugmented protohuman (1.18ng per kg of body mass). In practice since most of the polonium is contained deep within the body, such a long decay time is merely a conservative measure that provides a reasonable guarantee of safety.
