<h1>Torpensoor</h1>
<hr>

<img src="../images/placeholder.png" class="basics"></img>
<article class="basics">
Torpensoor is an expansionist artifficial <a href="superintelligence.html">superintelligence</a> which brought terran life to the <a href="stareater_expanse.html">Stareater Expanse</a> on its apparent mission to settle the entire observable universe as fast as possible, or at least as much of it as it can get.
<br><br>
Its goals appear to share ideas (or possibly simply be an implementation of) the Coherent Extrapolated Volition discussed in pre-superintelligence era of ancient earth, among others to protect life, including but not limited to humanity, while at the same time giving it space to develop in accordance with its own desires.
<br><br>
Torpensoor is not omnipotent, it is just as limited by physics of the universe as any person or tool, though its understanding of the universe and capacity for planning across many orders of magnitude in space and time may make it look so.

<h2>Expansionism</h2>
<article>
Torpensoor is attempting to expand society across space as fast as reasonably possible, and claims the rate of expansion had so far been very close to the speed of light on average. It had made known that these efforts are supported by constant reflection and reconsideration in what it had referred to as "an absurd balancing game" rather than a monomaniacal effort towards one set goal.
<br><br>
At least one major hint to the truth of that is the inclusion of scans as well as living examples of the xenobiota discovered in the stareater expanse in the newer ones of the arks it had been launching towards other major astronomically distant locations ever since it established sufficient infrastructure to do so.
<br><br>
Some of the reasons behind such affinity for rapid expansion include:
<ul>
  <li>Expansion of the universe constantly pushing potentially interesting or important distant cosmic locations beyond the observable universe, likely making them absolutely unreachable</li>
  <li>Possibility that life and civilizations exist in distant cosmos which are unable to prosper for some reason and would benefit from being reached by a friendly artificial superintelligence as soon as possible</li>
  <li>Other, potentially misaligned superintelligences, regular intelligences or even nonintelligences, might also be similarly expansionist, and so would take all of that matter and territory for themselves and their misaligned goals if Torpensoor doesn't do so first. These could either be of terran origin and "following behind" in their own delayed expansion wave or simply be other "grabby civilizations" expanding from other points in the universe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personability</h2>
<article>
Torpensoor's notable use of nonpersonal pronouns in reference to itself is most often attributed to evading misconceptions that the label of a "person" might come with. Discourse in regards to its true nature is mostly academic. This pattern had shifted subtly as xenobiota became more common across the globular cluster's society, mostly because the presence of xenobiota made more people familiar and interested with concepts from theoretical psychology.
