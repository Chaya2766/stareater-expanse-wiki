<article><b>Unaccountable Agents</b> (UAAs) are beings capable of complex reasoning and taking initiative to act on their own when faced with previously unmentioned obstacles to achieve a given goal, but incapable of being meaningfully deterred from undesirable behaviour if it is necessary to achieve the given goal (paperclip maximizer archetype) and incapable of being rehabilitated without significant direct intervention in their mind. AI agents are the primary target but it isn't specified, and wetware-based organic UAAs as well as other cases are accounted for, and it is notable that many commonly available AI agents would not fall under the classification thanks to their safety alignment.
<br><br>
UAAs are not outlawed, but subject to a special set of regulations, which include being registered to an owner, distributor or organization, which is to be responsible for action taken by any given UAA, and also prohibits their use in certain areas and information spaces, and extensive guidance on goal specification for UAAs is provided otherwise.</article>
<br><br>
<article><b>Gray areas</b> are explicitly defined under Catalict's law, rather than allowed to form naturally. This ofcourse gives rise to double-gray areas where in some cases it is difficult to decide whether someone had fallen into the gray area or was either decisively innocent or decisively guilty, but in general there is a bias towards ruling that any given act simply fell into the gray area when there is such uncertainty.
<br><br>
Gray areas have an innertia system, where occasional infraction will generally result in no consequence, but falling into the gray area scores infraction points that decay over time, and as they accumulate, warnings will appear, and consequences will begin to fall with increasing severity. The system is built to disincentivize "loitering in the gray area", where a person that sustains a given number of points will still be accumulating legal innertia, leading to increasingly severe consequences even if they merely maintain their infraction points at a steady level.
<br><br>
In practice this means that being a good enough citizen or organization puts you in a position where you can occasionally do something truly messed up and suffer no consequences or comically small consequences as long as it is not too egregious, making particularly bad one-time accidental offenses less likely to ruin an individual or organization and more likely that ones consistently skirting the law will suffer some level of meaningful consequence.
<br></br>
Worth noting is that this is already the case in most legal systems, except that it is not usually a clearly documented, consistent, intentional function of the legal system, but rather a natural result of social instincts of the ruling entities, which notably vary vastly between species and neurotypes. The approach of officially defined legal gray areas merely provides clarity for everyone in the notably multi-species environment of Noca Bell. Officially documenting and codifying things that are usually left implicit is one of the overall themes of Catalict's governance.</article>
