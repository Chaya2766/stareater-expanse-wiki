<h1>Civic chips</h1>

<article class="basics">
Civic chips are one of the more widespread forms of <a href="computation.html">computronium</a> and one of the easiest ways to produce additional computing power. The original civic chip was a community-driven open project, made by collaboration of independent settlers, asteroid miners, and numerous other people whose lives place them far away from the centralized manufacturing centers of society, which at the time the project started were a necessity for producing usable computer hardware. Over time the project expanded, resulting in a series of chips all optimized for different methods and scales of manufacturing.
<br><br>
The chips all have dimensions of 10mm by 10mm by 1mm and use the same interface, making them largely interchangeable with each other.
<br><br>
In the meta sense, these were written based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0244">Beyond Cmos</a> paper.

<article>
Civic 2 relies on indium arsenide tunneling field effect transistors, and can be easily produced through ion beam printing, requiring only materials that are easily extracted through low temperature electrolysis.

<h1>Civic 3</h1>

<article>
Civic 3 relies on graphene nanoribbon tunneling field effect transistors, exploiting graphene's ability to act as a p-type or n-type semiconductor depending on the presence of electrostatic charge. It requires equipment capable of forming graphene for that purpose. In terms of material, the chip is made almost entirely from carbon, making it very cheap to manufacture if the equipment to do so is available.

<h1>Civic 4</h1>

<article>
Civic 4 relies on bilayer pseudospin field effect transistors, exploiting quantum effects occurring between closely placed sheets of graphene and leaving the realm of moving charges to flip bits to instead manipulate the spin of electrons for that purpose. It requires equipment capable of forming graphene for that purpose, as well as very precise nanoscale assembly equipment to ensure exact spacing of the graphene nanoribbons, and the extra space needed also halves the number of transistors that could be packed into the chip. The chip operates remarkably close to the hard limit imposed by the landauer principle, consuming only about 10 times more energy per bit flip than the minimum for room temperature.
