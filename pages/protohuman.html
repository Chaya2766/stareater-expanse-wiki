<article class="basics">
"Protohuman" is the common term for Homo Sapiens, a diverse species which is a direct evolutionary ancestor to every other species in the human genus. The continued existence of protohumans is largely owed to genetic libraries holding digitized human DNA dating all the way back to Terra.
<br><br>
The term is extensible to any other species which had diverged far enough to form separate species, such as in the far future tarici as they exist now might be known as proto<a href="tarici.html">tarici</a> if there are many other species that had diverged from them by then.

For collaborative writing purposes this helps fit the setting into human-absent or human-taken writing where humanity is either not present at all or so rigidly defined that the existence of a distant human-descendant civilization like the Stareater Expanse is not possible.
<br><br>
Most science fiction settings in which aliens exist will present at least one alien species that is psychologically indistinguishable from humans and at least somewhat anatomically similar, which is sufficient to bridge the gap by using it in place of humans as needed.
