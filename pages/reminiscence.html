Reminiscence (Remi for short) is a modified protohuman, member of the <a href="reminiscence_divergency.html">Reminiscence divergency</a> and the <a href="family_mechanics.html#divergency">source</a> of Felicity. She had been primarily occupied with passive personal growth and hedonist activities ever since her successful mind uploading.
<br><br>
Remi is a good example of an average organic inhabitant of the Stareater Expanse, albeit somewhat technologically stunted due to her unwillingness to make use of pieces of technology and especially augmentation that had not been validated by her more capable digital divergents.

<h2>neural activity collection</h2>

<article>
Remi's entire nervous system is probed with leads that collect membrane potential from her neurons and allow it to be recorded for external storage. This augmentation is an example of something which is still very expensive even in what otherwise holds the appearance a post scarcity economy.
<br><br>
These are long nested bundles of carbon (conductive) and boron nitride (insulating) nanotubes, on one end connected to analog-digital voltage converters that quantize voltages between the tubes into digital data, and on the other end tipped with protein that allow them to hook into the membranes of neurons and transfer the cross-membrane voltage to the nanotubes. Producing a single such probe carries a trivial cost when done at scale with the relevant specialized machinery, but Remi had to acquire one for each of her 100 billion neurons, predictably blowing up the cost into something better thought as an investment. Implantation process was also nontrivial and carried a massive cost of time, as each of the probes had to be precisely guided through whole centimetres of brain tissue without accidentally becoming attached to any other neurons along the way.
<br><br>
The voltages are quantized 1000 times per second and saved in 16 bit precision, yielding nearly 200TB/s of constant data flow (= 17.28EB per day) that has to be saved into portable drives she carries attached to her body and swaps routinely. For comparison, the total of internet traffic on earth during terran year 2023 averaged out to be 152TB/s, quite close to the amount of data produced by Remi.
